# 📚 Projects

### Barbados Traffic Prediction using Neural Networks
Predicting traffic using computer vision to identify the root causes of traffic in a Barbados roundabout. Full data science pipeline leveraging Pytorch, YOLO model, Random Forest models, and other machine learning techniques.

### Understanding Cancer Outcomes: Breast vs. Cervical Cancer
The project investigates survival patterns in breast and cervical cancer using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Patients with the same diagnosis often experience different outcomes based on factors such as age, cancer stage, treatment received, and other clinical variables. Understanding these patterns can support improvements in patient care and the personalization of treatment strategies. Full Data Science pipeline leveraging Python (including parametric machine learning, classic regression, and boosting methods for prediction)

### Upcoming
- A Python function to be added to the language: *EDA function that takes a dataframe and returns characteristics beyond df.describe()*
- Global Statistical Analysis of Sentiment and Bias in News Headlines: *A measure of polarization in our society*
